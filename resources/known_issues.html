<p>This mod is basically a big plate of spaghetti code and is mostly made up of code snippets I've found on the internet or cobbled together for one reason or another. At the moment I wouldn't recommend that any other person even try to use it, though a glance at some of the code may help if you know what you are looking for.</p>

<p>All that said, it should work for my mods that use it and it will get better over time. If something goes wrong, chances are it will be with the mod using this one and not this base mod itself.</p>
